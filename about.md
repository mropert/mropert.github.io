## Projects

With a colleague of mine, we wrote a unified C++ API to query all sorts of SQL databases.
It's called CDBC and it's unfortunately not open-source yet.
In the meantime you can take a look at the [poster](https://github.com/murex/cdbc/blob/master/poster/CDBC%20CppCon%202016%20Poster.pdf)
we shown at CppCon 2016.

I'm also a contributor to the [Conan C++ Package Manager](https://www.conan.io/).
