    My name is Mathieu, I'm 34 and I write C++ for a living.

    I was born in France so of course I'm a pedantic snob who likes wine and pastries.

    Clich√©s aside, I enjoy coding, automating stuff, photography, cinema, role-playing games (both pen & paper and live action) and video games.
    And also wine (but not only the french ones).

    I've worked in various areas, ranging from kernel programming to web development, financial software, databases and videogames.
    My current favorite subject is package management, which I think the lack of has been holding back C++ for years now.

    I Used to run the [C++ French User Group (CppFRUG)](http://cppfrug.org/) meetup in Paris but have since moved to Sweden.

    You should easily be able meet me at the [Sweden C++ Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/swedencpp/) in Stockholm,
    but also at various C++ conferences where I usually try to attend.
