  One morning where jetlag robbed me of my sleep, I decided to start a blog.

Hello everyone,

It's about 7 AM (Paris time) and I've finally decided to open a blog. Which is pretty unusual, considering I'm never up before 8 (at least).

The truth is, I've been thinking about sharing some thoughts for a few months now and coming back from a trip to the US has been a tipping point (that and jetlag waking me up at 5 AM in the morning).

Here I'll talk about tech and software development, with a big focus on C++. You should find more details in the About section.

So, you should expect more content soon, first being my trip report to CppCon 2017.
