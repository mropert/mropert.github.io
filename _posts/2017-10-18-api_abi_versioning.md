title: My CppCon 2017 talk about API & ABI versioning is online!
tags: [cpp, events]

  When you make a change in your code, it's important to consider the potential impacts on your clients. At CppCon, I gave a talk
  about those impacts, both on API & ABI, and how to advertise them.

As I said in my [trip report](/2017/10/12/cppcon2017\/), I had two talks at CppCon this year.
The first one was about [using CMake for Modular Design](/2017/10/14/modern_cmake_video\/).
The second one is about changes in your library will impact your clients through API & ABI and how to tell them about it through
versioning:

You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017/blob/master/Presentations/API%20%26%20ABI%20Versioning/API%20%26%20ABI%20Versioning%20-%20Mathieu%20Ropert%20-%20CppCon%202017.pdf).

If you missed the talk, I'll give it again at Meeting C++ [next month](http://meetingcpp.com/2017/talks/items/Cpp_API___ABI_versioning.html).
