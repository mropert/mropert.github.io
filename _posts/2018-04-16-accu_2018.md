I must start by confessing to some ignorance: I didn't know about ACCU, what they did or how long
they've been around until last year when somebody asked me if I planned to submit a paper there.

It's great to see that the British had an association with quality conferences and publications
for so long. In comparison France only has (to my knowledge) a couple of for-profit magazines on
programming that never struck me as worth mentioning. As for conferences, of course we have
the great Paris User Group but we fall short in terms of native languages conferences.

## Keynotes

To me, keynotes should be the highlight of a conference. I usually have big expectations from them.
They should challenge my views, open new horizons and leave me inspired as if I just got out of
Plato's cavern.

### A confusing start

In that respect, I have to admit that ACCU 2018 and I started on the wrong foot. The opening
keynote was about diversity and inclusivity, a certainly present (and kind of polarizing) topic.
It was 25 minutes long (out of a potential full hour), in which the presenter, Gen Ashley,
simply explained her biography and then went on to show pictures and video ads of her women
user group.

I'm sure she ment well, and I believe ACCU wanted to send a message by having their opening keynote
on that topic, but to me it just fell flat. There was just no content here to challenge my views
or give me something to ponder. A 5 minutes lightning talk on the next day about a sociology
[paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617741719) gave much more food for thought,
an observation shared by most people I talked about to.

### Getting better, with sponsors

The second keynote, a presentation of the Kotlin language by Hadi Hariri was certainly better, but
still not quite there. There were certainly some insights to draw from a study of another language,
but instead of focusing example, the talk went on a bit too long on live coding and by the end
it felt like a product ad. And like Patrice Roy on that matter, I don't like keynotes that look
like they're trying to sell me something.

I understand that JetBrains (the makers of Kotlin) was a sponsor to the conference and sometimes
a paid-for talk is a necessary evil, but in this case another label could have been better.
Someone actually told me "it was not a keynote, it was a mandatory talk to which people may not
have gone otherwise" and I think that's an accurate description. Mandatory talks are not
necessarily a bad thing, they are a great occasion to push people outside their confort zone and
show them sometimes they wouldn't have seen otherwise. I for one would probably not have chosen
a talk on a language that used to run on the JVM if I had the choice and I would have missed
some interesting insights.

### Be careful what you wish for

With Lisa Lippincott's keynote "The Shape of a Program" I got what I asked, and then some. The
content was certainly new and challenging, to the point that I'm still not entirely sure what I
saw.
