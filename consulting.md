I offer consulting services in software engineering and game development in Stockholm and remotely. I have close to
20 years of experience in writing clean and fast C++ code and I'll be happy to apply my expertise to your codebase
or share it with your employees in a training. 

### Consulting

I specialize in performance & profiling in games and other C++ applications. Through my career I had the chance to work with various technologies and industries
in which I can also bring some expertise, such as:
* Multithreading
* Graphics (OpenGL, DirectX 9/11, Vulkan)
* Build systems
* Filesystems
* Networking / HTTP
* Operating systems / kernel programming
* Technical leadership

### Training

I have given multiple company trainings and conference talks over the years and can offer a range of existing material or create one tailored to your needs.
Examples include:
* Modern C++ best practices
* Profiling & performance troubleshooting
* Introduction to graphics programming
* Modern CMake guidelines

Check out my [recorded conference talks](/about#talks) for a preview.
