I offer consulting services in software engineering and game development in Stockholm and remotely. I have close to
20 years of experience in writing clean and fast C++ code and I'll be happy to apply my expertise to your codebase
or share it with your employees in a training. Check out my [talks](/about) for a sample of what I've done before.

Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:mro@puchiko.net) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieu-ropert-a7b7501/).
